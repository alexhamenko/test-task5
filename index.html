            <h1>Our Solution</h1>
            <p>BrainVu uses a non-invasive and remote mobile/AR/VR camera to extract physiological bio-markers that indicatechanges in brain activities and extract human emotional responses including: Mental Load, Stress Level and Emotional Engagement. Using these responses BrainVu can connect to a multitude of platforms and provide emotional and mental representation for those responses.</p>

                    <h2>Capture of Psychological Bio Markers</h2>
                    <p>BrainVu analyzes a spectrum of unique eye measurements to identify changes in alertness, attention i.e. mental effort. To understand the consumer’s tendency toward a certain subject by reenacting sensory and emotional experiences (such as taste, video and more) BrainVu uses a set of questions and responses measured by the system.</p>

                    <p>By combining the indices developed together with additional bio markers such as HRV, Gaze, facial coding, response time and others BrainVu has created the BrainVu Sentiment Index. It gauges both tendency towards a specific products/touch points as well as the emotional engagement (stress excitement, mental load) of the consumer during the research experience.</p>
